# Python List Operations

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates fundamental list operations as part of a weekly assignment.

The script, `list_operations.py`, performs a series of actions on a Python list, showcasing how to manipulate data structures efficiently.

## **Assignment Instructions**

The program addresses the following tasks:

1.  Create an empty list called `my_list`.
2.  Append the elements `10, 20, 30, 40` to `my_list`.
3.  Insert the value `15` at the second position (index 1) of the list.
4.  Extend `my_list` with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5.  Remove the last element from `my_list`.
6.  Sort the list in ascending order.
7.  Find and print the index of the value `30` in the sorted list.

## **How to Run the Program**

### **Prerequisites**

-   Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### **Steps**

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
    *Remember to replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub details.*

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3.  **Execute the Script**:
    ```bash
    python list_operations.py
    ```

The program will run and print the final index of the value `30` to your console.
